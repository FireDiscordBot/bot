If you're hosting the world, you'll need a decent PC and plenty of free RAM/CPU available for it to use. Checking these values while hosting and letting us know may help us help you.

Both players will also need a decent internet connection. If your connection isn't too stable, you may experience some issues such as falling into the void and timing out.
Lowering your render distance can sometimes help if you're timing out so give that a try!

If you're trying to play with a big modpack, it's important to note that some mods weren't designed to be used with Open to LAN (and therefore inviting friends with Esssential) so you may encounter isssues.

Make sure you have all the details about the issue ready to provide to the support team.
